  <h1 id="proposal">Proposal</h1>
<h2 id="team-members">Team Members</h2>
<p>Bader Alshemaimri, Callan Fisher, Zach Lamb, Zhongzhi Zhang</p>
<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>
<p>These ideation questions are the same as before. Your answers should represent
the integration of creative ideas from every team member.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of your app?</li>
</ul>
<p>Drink Together</p>
<ul>
<li>What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?</li>
</ul>
<p>People can collaboratively recommend, rate and share bars locations. They can invite their friends using the app without needing to call them. </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The usual size of a bar crawl group is roughly 15-20 people ,but the experience is relative. </p>
<ul>
<li>What skills do people need in order to do this activity?</li>
</ul>
<p>They need to be familiar with using social websites because drink together is built upon these.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this activity for fun or for something practical?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is practical because it helps people stay organized ,and it can also keep them safe because other people, such as loved ones, can know where everyone is located at all times. It can definitely be fun in the sense that the activity of drinking is fun…..If done responsibly of course! </p>
<ul>
<li>How can a person see what everyone else is doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person can see his/her friend’s location on the map. He can also chat with him/her.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can a person see the most recent result of everyone’s collaborative effort?</li>
</ul>
<p>By adding a status under every profile indicating whether a person left a bar or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>What can an admin see (i.e., God’s mode)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The admin can see all bars, they can see how many users are at each bar (i.e. anonymized hordes), they can see how many people are using the chat feature with chronological data, and they can see which customers are repeats of the app.</p>
<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<p>For each person on the team, jot down a list of ideas credited to that person.
It’s okay to credit multiple people for the same idea. The rationale of this
section of the proposal is to demonstrate that everyone on the team contributes
useful ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Callan Fisher<ul>
<li>move and select bars on a map and a route of some sorts</li>
<li>Chat (everyone’s idea)
*Map (also everyone’s idea)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zhongzhi Zhang<ul>
<li>launch/join a bar crawl(e.g. would you like to go to a musical Irish bar tonight?)</li>
<li>choose whether to invite or whether to expose your bar crawl plan to some people else(friendship relationship maybe?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Join an existing bar crawl(like join a slack channel)</li>
<li>Bader Alshermaimri<ul>
<li>Status ( in bar, looking for bar? (active), inactive)</li>
<li>rate or recommend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zach Lamb<ul>
<li>Overall idea about scheduling a bar crawl</li>
<li>Chat (everyone’s idea)
*Map (also everyone’s idea)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<p>A reasonable way to implement a functional prototype of your together app
is to build upon the service-matching app (i.e. uber). Discuss what additional
efforts may be required from your team to develop the together app.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What existing components of the uber app your team can reuse?</p>
<p><em>User login and logout
</em>Map
<em>Navbar
</em>data.jsx file
*worker.jsx file</p>
</li>
<li><p>What new components and features your team may need to build?</p>
<p><em>Chat
</em>Status
*Filter for different bars</p>
</li>
<li><p>What new skills your team will still need to acquire?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing chat, filtering data to display bars, showing anonymized data,and showing different bar categories</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>This is a preliminary proposal. Next week, your team will receive feedback and
will work on building a <em>mockup</em> of this app. The week after that, your team
will start implementing the app.</p>
